Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

    Under 18.5 they are underweight
    Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
    Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
    Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
    Above 35 they are clinically obese.

Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. 
A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 
The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating. 

On every year that is evenly divisible by 4 **except** every year 
that is evenly divisible by 100 **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400


1.   If the year is evenly divisible by 4, go to step 2. Otherwise, go to step 5.
2.    If the year is NOT divisible by 100, go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 3.
3.    If the year is evenly divisible by 100 and also evenly divisible by 400 go to step 4. Otherwise, go to step 5.
4.    The year is a leap year (it has 366 days).
5.    The year is not a leap year (it has 365 days).

'''

# year = int(input("Which year do you want to check?\n"))
# if year % 4 == 0:
#     if year % 100 != 0:
#         print(f"{year} is a leap year")

Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number. 
For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
"Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
"Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
"Your score is **z**."
